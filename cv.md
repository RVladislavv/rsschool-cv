### **About Me:**
I've liked programming since high school. When I was in the 11th grade of school, I did not know which university and what specialty to enroll in. 

I started learning HTML and CSS. I didn't study it deeply at that time, because it seemed to me that website builders(like lpgeneration, wix and etc) would displace web studios. After that, I was engaged in advertising for a couple of years. I had to take ready-made website templates and change data, pictures, text - this is how I practiced HTML and CSS.

When the coronavirus started in 2020, I got sick and realized that I didn't like what I was doing.
In 2021, I decided to start studying web development in more depth.

```

    let rem = number % 2;
    if (rem) {
        return "Odd";
    } 
    return "Even";
}
```

### **Experience:**
As I wrote in About Me, I edited landing pages: I changed fonts, colors, images, text, titles, links - when I was advertising on Facebook and Google.
